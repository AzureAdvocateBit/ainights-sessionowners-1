# AI Nights Content - Beginner Track
## For Session Owners - Train the Trainer

This is a GitHub repository provided for **session owners** to access and learn content that can be delivered at **AI Nights** across the globe in **April and September**. This content is designed for the **Beginner Track** and is approx **2 hours worth** of content. Some elements of the workshops are for the speakers to demo and other elements are for attendees to complete on their own devices and with their own Azure Subscription. Please find the public workshop content for attendees here:  [https://github.com/amynic/AINights](https://github.com/amynic/AINights)

## Session Information 
**Session Title:** Creating applications that can see, hear, speak or understand - using Microsoft Cognitive Services

**Session Abstract:** In this workshop you will be introduced to the [Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/), a range of offerings you can use to infuse intelligence and machine learning into your applications without needing to build the code from scratch. 
We will cover pre-trained AI APIs, such as [computer vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/) and [text analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/directory/lang/), that are accessed by REST protocol. Then look at how you can host these [models in containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support), giving you the ability to run Cognitive Services offline and on edge devices. Finally we will dive into Custom AI that uses transfer learning - [Microsoft Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/). This enables you to provide a small amount of your own data to train an image classification model. Wrapping the workshop up by building our custom trained AI into an application - using [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/logic-apps/) and [Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/), tools that are ideal for proof of concepts within machine learning
